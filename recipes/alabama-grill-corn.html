        <p>"Alabama Grill Corn" is my version of Mexican Street Corn, or at least that's where I got the idea from. It's a savory, stick-in-your-teeth kinda dish that goes perfectly with barbeque.</p>

        <p>For this one, you're gonna want to follow the recipe <a href="../recipes/barbeque-sauce.html"> here</a>. You'll also have to make the choice bewtween blue cheese or feta cheese -- I know, blue isn't to everyone's tastes, but if you like it it's exceptional on this dish.</p>
        
        
        <h2 class="main">Ingredients</h2>
