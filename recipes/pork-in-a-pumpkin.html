        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Pork in a pumpkin is a delicious dish.</p>
        <p>The pumpkin serves as a braising vessel for the pork, which is divided into easy to serve chunks. The browning on the pork does not lose its color or crispness during its bath in the apple cider, and the pumpkin gains wonderful flavor for its efforts.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Pie Pumpkin (One or two depending on the amount of pork)</li>
            <li>Pork (I tend to go for a Boston Butt, also called pork shoulder)</li>
            <li>Hard Apple Cider</li>
            <li>Flour</li>
            <li>Assorted Fall Spices</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Cut the pork into manageable chunks.</li>
            <li>Combine flour and spices</li>
            <li>Coat pork in flour</li>
            <li>Brown pork and take in the smell of the spices</li>
            <li>Hollow pie pumpkins, but keep the top!</li>
